# BrickSort

## Overview

BrickSort is a standalone web application for browsing, analysing, and organising LEGO sets.

The application focuses on advanced sorting, dimensional comparison, and personal collection management, enabling users to explore and organise sets beyond simple price-based views.

## Core Features

### LEGO Set Catalogue

Users can browse a catalogue of LEGO sets with detailed metadata, including pricing, piece counts, and physical dimensions.

### Advanced Sorting & Comparison

Sets can be sorted and compared using multiple calculated and physical properties, including:

- **Price per piece**
- **Total price**
- **Volume**
- **Surface area**
- **Dimensions**

  - Length
  - Width
  - Height

These options enable deeper analysis beyond basic sorting by price or name.

### User Collection Tracking

Registered users can maintain a personal collection by:

- Marking which sets they **own**
- Viewing and managing their collection in one place
- Updating ownership status over time

### Lists & Personal Organisation

Users can organise sets using multiple list types:

- **Favourites** – preferred or standout sets
- **Watchlist** – sets of interest for future consideration
- **Custom lists** – user-defined collections

  - Examples: “Display Sets”, “Space Theme”, “Large Builds”

Each set can belong to multiple lists, allowing flexible organisation and categorisation.

## Planned / In-Progress Features

- Filtering by theme, year, piece count, and price range
- User authentication and persistent storage
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile devices
- Improved comparison views and data visualisation

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend:** (e.g. React)
- **Backend:** (e.g. Java / Spring Boot or Node.js)
- **Database:** (e.g. PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- **Authentication:** User accounts and session management

> The tech stack may evolve as development progresses.

## Purpose

This project is intended as a **portfolio piece** to demonstrate:

- Full-stack application design
- Data modelling and sorting logic
- User-focused feature design
- Software engineering best practices

It is developed as part of ongoing learning alongside a **BSc in Computing & IT**.
